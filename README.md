# APCS Edhesive
Hello! My name is Gary Tou, a student who took the Edhesive AP Computer Science Course in 2017-2018. As of September 2018, I had decided to remove my solutions due to the increase attention this repository has been recieving. I hope you would learn how to solve them yourself!

**Here are a few tips for you:**
- Stay ahead of your work.
- Use either Eclipse, IntelliJ instead of Dr. Java.
- Use GitHub/other web services to store your code. This allows you to easily work at home and school without copying and pasting code.
- Work on personal side projected using Java to perfect your skills. My friend and I worked on Restroom Logs, which can be found somewhere on my profile. This project has taught me a lot about Java, Libraries, Java graphics (Swing), and creating a function application/software.


If you every have any questions about Java or programming in general, feel free to contact me!

Good luck on the AP Exam,
Gary Tou
