* Lesson 32 Coding Activity 3
* 
* For the Lesson 32 activities, you will be asked to write one or more methods.
* Use the template to write a main method that tests each of your methods, 
* then paste everything into the code runner box. Your submission should 
* begin with the first import statement and end with the final }.
* 
* Write a method that takes two integer parameters and prints them in reverse.
* 
* This method must be called swap and should take two integer parameters. 
* 
* Calling swap(3, 7) would print 7 3.
